This driver is a super-compact version of the competitor ST7789 drivers, with a
focus on being as light as possible on the Pico. It can display strings, chars, 
and individual pixels for pixelart as shown. It saves lots of overhead by not
supporting microSD storage, or including animation support by default. Ideal for
super light or multi-use applications.

Also included is an example of how a sprite can be included as pixelart, I hope 
the example is useful and entertaining (simply remove the references and sprite 
file for a more normal output).
