// ---- quadrature encoder interface example
//
// the PIO program reads phase A/B of a quadrature encoder and increments or
// decrements an internal counter to keep the current absolute step count
// updated. At any point, the main code can query the current count by using
// the quadrature_encoder_*_count functions. The counter is kept in a full
// 32 bit register that just wraps around. Two's complement arithmetic means
// that it can be interpreted as a 32-bit signed or unsigned value, and it will
// work anyway.
//
// As an example, a two wheel robot being controlled at 100Hz, can use two
// state machines to read the two encoders and in the main control loop it can
// simply ask for the current encoder counts to get the absolute step count. It
// can also subtract the values from the last sample to check how many steps
// each wheel as done since the last sample period.
//
// One advantage of this approach is that it requires zero CPU time to keep the
// encoder count updated and because of that it supports very high step rates.
//
