= Sending and receiving IR (infra-red) codes using the PIO

This example shows how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) to send and receive infra-red frames in the 'NEC' format that is used by many consumer remote control applications.

It performs a loopback test by transmitting IR codes via an IR LED and receiving them on an IR detector. The results are sent to the default serial terminal connnected via UART or USB as configured in the SDK.

The tasks of encoding and decoding the data are offloaded to the RP2040 PIO state machines. This releases the main processor cores to concentrate on other tasks.

== Wiring information

Connect GPIO 14 to the positive side ('anode') of an IR LED via a suitable series resistor e.g. 1.5k Ohms, and the negative side ('cathode') to ground.

Connect GPIO 15 to the output of a 3.3v IR detector such as the VS1838b, and wire the power connections of the detector to the 3v3 and ground. The program expects the decoder output to be low (logic '0') when a carrier is detected.

== Build information

The code is organised into three sub-directories. These contain the loopback example and two libraries for the IR transmit and receive functions.

After a successful build the executable program can be found in the **build/ir_loopback** directory.
