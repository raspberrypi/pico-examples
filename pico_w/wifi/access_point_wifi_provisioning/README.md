### Access point wifi provisioning

This example demonstrates provisioning wifi credentials using an access point. The pico saves succesful credentials in flash, which it first uses when attempting to join wifi. If this fails, the pico starts an access point which you can connect to and input credentials. The DNS server means that any address you enter when connected to the access point will take you to the provisioning web page.
