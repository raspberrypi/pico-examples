### Doorbell

This example uses BLE to communicate between 2 Pico Ws. When the button on one Pico is pressed, the LED connected to the second Pico will illuminate.

To use this example, connect a LED in series with a 330 ohm resistor between pin 15 and ground on the client Pico. On the server Pico, connect a button between pin 15 and ground.
