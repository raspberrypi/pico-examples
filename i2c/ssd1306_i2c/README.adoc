= Attaching a SSD1306 OLED display via I2C

This example code shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico to the SSD1306 OLED display board. This device uses I2C for communications, and SSD1306 parts are happy running at 3.3.

== Wiring information

Wiring up the device requires 4 jumpers, to connect VCC (3.3v), GND, SDA and SCL. The example here uses I2C port 0, which is assigned to GPIO 12 (SDA) and 13 (SCL) in software. Power is supplied from the 3.3V pin.

[NOTE]
======
There are many different manufacturers who sell boards with the SSD1306 with an I2C interface. Whilst they all appear slightly different, they all have, at least, the same 4 pins required to power and communicate. When wiring up a board that is different to the one in the diagram, ensure you connect up as described in the previous paragraph.
