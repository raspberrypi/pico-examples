= Attaching a MCP9808 digital temperature sensor via I2C

This example code shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico to the MCP9808 digital temperature sensor board. 
======
This example reads the ambient temperature value each second from the sensor and sets upper, lower and critical limits for the temperature. The

== Wiring information

Wiring up the device requires 7 jumpers, to connect VDD, GND, SDA, SCL, A0, A1 and A2 pins. The example here uses I2C port 0, which is assigned to GPIO 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL) in software. Power is supplied from the VSYS pin.
