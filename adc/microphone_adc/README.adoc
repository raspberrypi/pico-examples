= Attaching a microphone using the ADC

This example code shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico with a standard analog microphone via the onboard analog to digital converter (ADC). In this example, we use an ICS-40180 breakout board by SparkFun but any analog microphone should be compatible with this tutorial. SparkFun have https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/mems-microphone-hookup-guide[written a guide] to this board that goes into more detail about the board and how it works.

[TIP]
======
An analog to digital converter (ADC) is responsible for reading continuous input signals that may range from 0 to a specified reference voltage (in the Pico's case this reference voltage is set by the supply voltage and can be measured on pin 35, ADC_VREF) and converting them into 1s and 0s, ie. a number that can be digitally stored.
======

The Pico has a 12-bit ADC, meaning that a read operation will return a number ranging from 0 to 4095 (2^12 - 1) for a total of 4096 possible values. Therefore, the resolution of the ADC is 3.3/4096, so roughly steps of 0.8 millivolts.

== Wiring information

Wiring up the device requires 3 jumpers, to connect VCC (3.3v), GND, and AOUT. The example here uses ADC0, which is GP26. Power is supplied from the 3.3V pin.

WARNING: Most boards will take a range of voltages from the Pico's default 3.3v to the 5 volts commonly seen on other microcontrollers. Ensure your board works with either the 3.3v or 5v supplied by the Pico.
